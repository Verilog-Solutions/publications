Inspired by the recent token bridge exploits, Verilog research team surveyed the existing cross-chain bridge solutions and decided to perform an independent, external security analysis on EVO DeFi Bridge. EVO DeFi Bridge is a cross-chain bridge connected to multiple EVM-compatible chains, including Ethereum, BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, and Oasis Emerald ParaTime. Verilog Solutions has conducted on-chain analytics and external analysis on the open-sourced portion of EVO DeFi Bridge in hope of improving the safety of funds and transparency across the crypto ecosystem.

To conduct the analysis, the Verilog team used various techniques including but not limited to event emission extraction, cross-chain fuzzy matching, and byte code comparison. The goal of this analysis is to discover whether proper collateralization and governance are in place for EVO DeFi Bridge. It is important to note that this analysis was conducted unilaterally without correspondence from  EVO DeFi Bridge, and some parts of the source code are not available to the Verilog team. Therefore, this analysis is based on incomplete information and best-effort conjugation.

## Smart Contract Analysis

The EVO DeFi Bridge Contract Analysis

1. address `0x06c30Af8A82AAf9cFd319f8644584276Bfbec42f`

    This address has been used on BSC, Polygon, Oasis, Fantom, Heco, Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Moonriver and OKEXchain.
    However, only the contract on BSC has been verified, thus this is the only contract we can analyze.
    
2. address `0x7cca0859058aa03301106ab8aba1707a16a30821`
    
    This address has been used on HarmonyONE, Gnosis and Optimism. However, none of the addresses has verified contracts.

### Bytecode Analysis

We inspect the bytecode and source code of EVO DeFi Bridge contract in all the aforementioned chains. The code is available at [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/Verilog-Solutions/Crosschain-Tracing-Analysis/tree/main/BytecodeAnalysis).

1. We start with the only available source code, [EVO DeFi Bridge @ BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0x06c30Af8A82AAf9cFd319f8644584276Bfbec42f#code). We also obtain its opcode and bytecode.
2. We obtain the opcode representation of EVO DeFi Bridge @ Arbitrum, Ethereum, Fantom and Polygon. 
    a. We compare the opcode diff between BSC's and every other. We observe that Arbitrum, Fantom and Polygon have the exact same opcode with BSC, so we confirm that **within these three blockchain, EVO DeFi Bridge operates using the same logic.**
    b. Comparing the opcode in BSC and in Ethereum, we observe a few different opcodes (as follows). Given only 27 out of 4864 opcodes are different and the others remain the same, the Ethereum version is very likely to be identical with 
    ```
    Unknown Opcode 3d => RETURNDATASIZE
    Unknown Opcode 3e => RETURNDATACOPY
    Unknown Opcode 1b => SHL
    Unknown Opcode 47 => SELFBALANCE
    ```

3. We obtain the bytecode of representation of EVO DeFi Bridge @ Avalanche, Cronos, Gnosis, HarmonyONE, Heco, Moonriver and Optimistic. 
    a. We observe that the bytecode of EVO DeFi Bridge @ Avalanche is identical to that in BSC, so we confirm EVO DeFi Bridge shares the same logic with Avalanche and BSC.
    b. Although Heco, Cronos, Moonriver, OKEX, HarmonyOne, Gnosis, Optimism are different from the original lBSC version. {Heco, Cronos, Moonriver} share the same set of bytecode; {OKEX, HarmonyOne, Gnosis, Optimism} share another same set of bytecode.

4. We continue to explore similarities among the BSC version, Heco version and  OKEX version. We decompile the bytecode using Panoramix decompiler.
5. We found that the Heco version and OKEX version implement the same set of ABI as the BSC version:
    ```
    decompiled interface => source code interface
    withdrawn(bytes32 _param1) => mapping(bytes32 => bool) public withdrawn;
    owner() => address public owner
    operator(address _operator) => mapping(address => uint8) public operator
    _fallback() payable => receive() external payable
    setOwner(address _new) => setOwner(address newOwner)
    unknown4b63d0a1(uint256 _param1, uint256 _param2) => setOperatorMode(address account, uint8 mode)
    unknown94241002() => withdraw(Withdraw[] calldata ws)
    unknown8033d687(?) => take(IERC20 token, uint amount, address payable to)
    unknown90cfe778(?) => deposit(IERC20 token, uint amount, uint8 to, bool bonus, bytes calldata recipient)
    ```


### Owner Analysis( )
There are in total 5 write functions & 3 read functions in EVO DeFi Bridge BSC Contract:

``` solidity=
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.10;
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol';
import './interfaces/IBridgePool.sol';

contract BridgePool is IBridgePool {
    address public owner;
    /*
      operator modes:
        1 - contract:creator
        2 - contract:withdrawer
        4 - withdrawer
        8 - taker
    */
    mapping(address => uint8) public operator;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public withdrawn;

    bool private entered = false;
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!entered, 'reentrant call');
        entered = true;
        _;
        entered = false;
    }

    constructor () {
        owner = tx.origin;
    }

    function setOwner(address newOwner) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, 'forbidden');
        owner = newOwner;
    }
    
    .....
    
```

The above contract shows that deployer of the contract has been set as the native owner of this contract, where owner can transfer ownership to another wallet address. 

The deployer - [0x40e0dcd7024030c7b5e1d474fe95aaf7bb880ad0](https://bscscan.com/address/0x40e0dcd7024030c7b5e1d474fe95aaf7bb880ad0) 

found out in the contract deployment transaction tx [0x2a788fa2eb1c4313d4bff1ae19e24ac5bfbd6c15b56c75ff512b16993905612d](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2a788fa2eb1c4313d4bff1ae19e24ac5bfbd6c15b56c75ff512b16993905612d) on BSCscan.
![contract deployment tx](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1z_FTX79.png)

After contract deployment, the deployer did not set new owner. Thus, until now, this address is still the owner of contract address `0x06c30Af8A82AAf9cFd319f8644584276Bfbec42f` on BSC, Polygon, Oasis, Fantom, Heco, Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Moonriver and OKEXchain.

### setOperatorMode( )

```solidity=
 function setOperatorMode(address account, uint8 mode) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, 'forbidden');
        operator[account] = mode;
     }
```

The owner of this smart contract can set operator mode for input `account`. 

### deposit( )

```solidity=
 function deposit(IERC20 token, uint amount, uint8 to, bool bonus, bytes calldata recipient) override external payable nonReentrant() {
        // 
        // ed only direct call or 'contract:creator' or 'contract:withdrawer'
        require(tx.origin == msg.sender || (operator[msg.sender] & (1 | 2) > 0), 'call from unauthorized contract');
        require(address(token) != address(0) && amount > 0 && recipient.length > 0, 'invalid input');

        if (address(token) == address(1)) {
            require(amount == msg.value, 'value must equal amount');
        } else {
            safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        }

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, address(token), to, amount, bonus, recipient);
    }

```

This deposit function allows users to deposit certain token to this smart contract. There are in total 5 inputs: 
1. `IERC20 token` - deposit ERC20 token address
2. `uint amount` - amount of ERC20 token
3. `to` - might be chainID
4. `bool bonus` - small amount of gas incentive trigger
5. `bytes calldata recipient` - recipient address on other chains


### withdraw( )
```solidity=
 function withdraw(Withdraw[] calldata ws) override external nonReentrant() {
        // allowed only 'withdrawer' or 'withdrawer' through 'contract:withdrawer'
        require(operator[msg.sender] == 4 || (operator[tx.origin] == 4 && operator[msg.sender] == 2), 'forbidden');

        for (uint i = 0; i < ws.length; i++) {
            Withdraw memory w = ws[i];

            require(!withdrawn[w.id], 'already withdrawn');
            withdrawn[w.id] = true;

            if (address(w.token) == address(1)) {
                require(address(this).balance >= w.amount + w.bonus, 'too low token balance');
                (bool success, ) = w.recipient.call{value: w.amount}('');
                require(success, 'native transfer error');
            } else {
                require(
                    w.token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= w.amount && address(this).balance >= w.bonus,
                    'too low token balance'
                );
                safeTransfer(w.token, w.recipient, w.amount);
            }

            if (w.bonus > 0) {
                // may fail on contracts
                w.recipient.call{value: w.bonus}('');
            }

            if (address(w.token) != address(1) && w.feeAmounts.length > 0) {
                for (uint j = 0; j < w.feeAmounts.length; j++) {
                    require(w.token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= w.feeAmounts[j], 'too low token balance');
                    safeTransfer(w.token, w.feeTargets[j], w.feeAmounts[j]);
                }
            }

            emit Withdrawn(w.id, address(w.token), w.recipient, w.amount);
        }
    }
```

withdraw function to allow users to receive the token from the dst chain.

### take( ) - ** high centralization risks **

```soldiity=
function take(IERC20 token, uint amount, address payable to) external override nonReentrant() {
    // allowed only 'taker'
    require(operator[msg.sender] == 8, 'forbidden');
    if (address(token) == address(1)) {
        to.transfer(amount);
    } else {
        safeTransfer(token, to, amount);
    }
}

```

As we previously mentioned, `setOperatorMode()` function can set input `address account` to different mode options. This `take()` function only allows `msg.sender` is 8 to pass the require conditions. Thus, 8 should be taker mode.

**The taker has the right to send tokens out from this contract.**
